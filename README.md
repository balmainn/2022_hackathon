# 2022 Hackathon
# This program is used to keep track of books that a teacher has. Teachers can look up books by ISBN10 and the program will add it to a list. They can also lend it out to students, or transfer the book to another teacher. 
# The program is command line based for right now, i tried to make it inuitive to use. Currently all choices with exception of exiting the program are made with integers, please keep that in mind. 
## There are 2 hard coded ISBNs for you to use, if you would like. They are A Series Of Unfortunate Events, books 1 and 2 of the series.
